# Shared ops/tooling bucket: holds the DB migration .sql files and the
# spectra-db.sh helper so a THROWAWAY shell (CloudShell VPC environments have
# no persistent storage) can fetch everything with one command instead of a
# manual re-upload every session. Later also the source for the ECS migrator
# task.
#
# Deliberately NOT the screenshots bucket: that one expires objects at 180 days,
# which would silently delete the migrations.
#
# Contents are a few KB, so cost is effectively zero.
